Primary theme (inductively generated) & Missing feature / enhancement request & User requests functionality that does not currently exist, or enhancement of existing capability. \\
Primary theme (inductively generated) & Unexpected behavior & Tool behaves incorrectly despite user following expected instructions or documentation. \\
Primary theme (inductively generated) & Authentication friction & User cannot authenticate/authorize smoothly due to token, flow, timeout, or identity setup problems. \\
Primary theme (inductively generated) & Configuration friction & User struggles to configure the tool due to complexity, rigid settings, or unclear setup requirements. \\
Primary theme (inductively generated) & Integration failure/issues & Interoperation with external systems fails or requires additional support/enhancement. \\
Primary theme (inductively generated) & User confusion / unclear documentation & User is confused, asks usage questions, or documentation is unclear/outdated/insufficient. \\
Primary theme (inductively generated) & Build/CI/installation/distribution release issues & Problems running/installing/building/distributing the tool in local or CI/CD environments. \\
Primary theme (inductively generated) & Performance issue & Tool functions but is too slow or resource intensive (or needs performance improvements). \\
Primary theme (inductively generated) & Security concerns & Reported vulnerability, unsafe default, leakage risk, or request to harden security posture. \\
Primary theme (inductively generated) & Notification/Logging Issues & Logs, errors, status output, or web/client feedback are unclear, noisy, or not actionable. \\
Primary theme (inductively generated) & Tedious Workflows & Workflow is overly manual or requires too many steps to achieve a routine task. \\
Secondary theme (inductively generated) & Operational Friction & Barriers in setup, environment, integration, or workflow execution where users know what to do but the system resists. \\
Secondary theme (inductively generated) & Cognitive Friction & Barriers in understanding or mental model clarity, where users do not know how to proceed. \\
Secondary theme (inductively generated) & Functional Reliability & Friction when expected function is undermined by failures, slowness, or security risk. \\
Secondary theme (inductively generated) & Functional Gap & Tool currently lacks capability needed for the user’s intended task. \\
Nielsen theme (deductive) & 1. Visibility of system status & System should keep users informed with timely, clear feedback about ongoing operations. \\
Nielsen theme (deductive) & 2. Match between system and the real world & Use familiar language and concepts; avoid internal jargon that conflicts with user expectations. \\
Nielsen theme (deductive) & 3. User control and freedom & Provide clear exits/undo paths so users can recover from unwanted states. \\
Nielsen theme (deductive) & 4. Consistency and standards & Use consistent terminology/behavior and follow ecosystem conventions. \\
Nielsen theme (deductive) & 5. Error prevention & Prevent avoidable mistakes with checks, guardrails, and confirmations before commitment. \\
Nielsen theme (deductive) & 6. Recognition rather than recall & Reduce memory burden by making required actions/options visible in the interface/help. \\
Nielsen theme (deductive) & 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use & Support efficient workflows for experts while remaining usable for less-experienced users. \\
Nielsen theme (deductive) & 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design & Avoid irrelevant/noisy information that hides key outputs or decisions. \\
Nielsen theme (deductive) & 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors & Error messages should be clear, specific, and provide actionable recovery guidance. \\
Nielsen theme (deductive) & 10. Help and documentation & Documentation and help text should be discoverable, accurate, and aligned with current behavior. \\
Affected component theme & Authentication/Authorization tools & Identity verification and permission logic, including OIDC flows, token handling, MFA, and RBAC behavior. \\
Affected component theme & CLI tooling & Command-line UX including command/flag behavior, prompts, and output formatting. \\
Affected component theme & Signing workflow & End-to-end client-side path used to produce cryptographic signatures for artifacts. \\
Affected component theme & Verification workflow & End-to-end client-side path used to validate signatures and trust decisions. \\
Affected component theme & Policy/configuration & Configuration and policy expression/interpretation (e.g., YAML/JSON, OPA/Rego, policy enforcement). \\
Affected component theme & Build/CI/Installation & Friction in installation/build and automated execution in CI/CD or scripted environments. \\
Affected component theme & Release pipeline & Maintainer-side release engineering: building, signing, and publishing official binaries/artifacts. \\
Affected component theme & Notification/Logging & Clarity/actionability of logs, warnings, status output, and debug traces. \\
Affected component theme & Core & Issue affects the overall tool/core behavior when a specific component boundary is unclear. \\
Affected component theme & API & Issues in API endpoints, request/response behavior, and API-facing interactions. \\
Affected component theme & Web Client & Issues in web UI/client/admin dashboard interactions and feedback. \\
Affected component theme & Key Management Core / Secrets Backend & Key/secret lifecycle and secure storage infrastructure, including KMS/HSM/keychain integrations. \\
